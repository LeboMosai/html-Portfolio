  <h1>About Me</h1>
</head>
<body>
  <p>I'm currently training to become a Web Developer, and I'm really enjoying both coding and design. I'm eager to seize any 
    opportunity to expand my knowledge. Right now, I'm concentrating on mastering the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. I've always 
    had a passion for creative design, which is reflected in my diploma in interior design. I've also experimented with tools 
    like Figma and Canva. Recently, I completed a UX/UI design course on Coursera, which sparked my interest even more.</p>
  
  <p>When I find some free time (which is rare at the moment!), I love spending it with my family, staying active, and watching 
    crime and drama series or movies. Some of my favorite actors include Denzel Washington, Liam Neeson, and Keanu Reeves. 
    I've also started gardening lately!</p>
  
  <p>Don't hesitate to get in touch if you believe I would be a good match for your company.</p>
